  <li><h2>Oppenheimer</h2></li><br>
  ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br><br><br>
  <img src="movie 1.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="">
  <p><strong>Director: Christopher Nolan</strong></p>
  <p>Oppenheimer rediscovers the power of huge closeups of people's faces as they grapple with who they are, and who other people have decided that they are, and what they've done to themselves and others
  </p><hr>
  <li><h2>Interstellar</h2></li><br>
  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br><br><br>
  <img src="movie 2.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="">
  <p><strong>Director: Christopher Nolan</strong></p>
  <p>
Interstellar is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away
